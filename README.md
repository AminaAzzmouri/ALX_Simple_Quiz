# ALX_Simple_Quiz

## Project Overview
This repository contains a simple interactive quiz web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz presents a single question with multiple-choice answers. Users select their answer and receive instant feedback indicating whether their choice was correct or not.

## Files in the Repository
- `index.html` — The HTML structure of the quiz page.
- `styles.css` — The CSS styles that design the quiz interface.
- `quiz.js` — The JavaScript logic that handles the quiz functionality and user interaction.

## How It Works
- The user sees a question and multiple answer options.
- After selecting an answer and clicking the "Submit Answer" button, the application checks if the selected answer matches the correct one.
- Feedback is displayed below the button: "Correct! Well done." for a correct answer or "That's incorrect. Try again!" for an incorrect one.

## Key Features
- Simple, clean user interface designed with basic CSS.
- Real-time answer validation using JavaScript.
- Easy to expand for more questions or features.

## Usage
Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to start the quiz.
